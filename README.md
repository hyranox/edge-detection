Welcome to CUSBS Modelling!
===================

To get started it is suggested that you use Linux for programming. The most user-friendly 'flavour' is Ubuntu which you can get [here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download). 

Quickstart
---------------

1. Open up a terminal
2. Install **python** (2.7.x) and **git** by typing, in the command line:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python2.7
3. Next, to copy the project run:`
git clone https://github.com/cusbs/edge-detection.git`
4. [Optional] Install a text editor [sublime-text-3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - the python package management tool for installing python software libraries
